# femto CSS

##motivation

I was tired of relearning css frameworks so I wrote my own to satisfy my most minimal of requirements

##disclaimer

It is not made to be the most general of frameworks, it is made for my needs. But I am happy if what it does helps you
I certainly feel it is simple enough to understand

##dependencies

I base it off from the amazing normalize.css
